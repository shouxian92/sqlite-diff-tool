# SQLite Diff Tool for Vindictus db3 files
A simple tool to generate SQLite queries out of two different sqlite files. There is currently no easy way to compare changes between two `.db3` files.

## Usage

1. Install any version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `>= 3.7`
2. Make sure you have downloaded this repository and run `python sqlite_diff.py` in this folder
3. Follow the instructions printed out
4. Look for an output file that was generated by the script ending with `.sql`

## Absence of primary key
There is currently a large number of tables in the database but none of the tables has a primary key.
