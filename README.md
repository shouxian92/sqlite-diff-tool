# SQLite Diff Tool for Vindictus db3 files
A simple tool to generate SQLite queries out of two different sqlite files. There is currently no easy way to compare changes between two `.db3` files.

## Usage

1. Install any version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `>= 3.7`
2. Make sure you have downloaded this repository
3. Copy your old and new sqlite files to where you downloaded this repository to
4. Run `python sqlite_diff.py` in this folder with your command line tool
5. Follow the instructions printed out (enter the name of the files)
6. Look for an output file that was generated by the script ending with `.sql`

## Goals

- [x] Basic functionality of generating INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements based on table differences
- [ ] Generate statements for handling of changes in table structure based on [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html) documentation
- [ ] UI functionality of selecting files
